# Rate API
Luxoft Rate Api Test

The Rates API is a free service for current and historical foreign exchange rates for different
currencies against Euro.

The purpose of this project is to storing and viewing currency exchange rates.


### Application info:
1. Developed with Java -version 17
2. Spring Boot -version 2.5.5
3. Spring Data JPA -version 2.5.5
4. The application was developed using "Package by Feature"

### To run the application:

1. Run as a Spring Boot Application, the way you prefer.
3. The server is configured to **localhost** by defaul at **8080** (**http://localhost:8080**)

### To use the endpoints of the application:

1. **http://localhost:8080/api/v1/retrieve** responsible to update the database with the new rates from the last x days defined on properties.
2. **http://localhost:8080/api/rate/2021-09-17** responsible to find an specific rate taking as a parameter the **date**.
3. **http://localhost:8080/api/v1/rate?start_date=2021-09-17&end_date=2021-09-19** responsible to find the data between range date informed take two **dates** as a parameters.

### To configure the application:

In the **application.properties** file we have some properties in other to customize the behavior of the application.


1. **com.luxoft.hsbc.exchangeratesapi.API_KEY** - The key generated by the **https://exchangeratesapi.io/**
2. **com.luxoft.hsbc.exchangeratesapi.URI** - The URI for the API (default: **http://api.exchangeratesapi.io/v1/**)
3. **com.luxoft.hsbc.LAST_MONTHS_IN_DAYS** - The days that will be storage in the database (30 days = 1 month), due the changes in the api we cannot get a range of date in the API for free, so instead to get the last two months by sending start date and end date, we start today and search the data in each day by deductingone day each day, doing a lot of requests to the api (what is not good, but for free it is okay), for example, if we request one month, it will make 30 requests to the api, so the problem is that the api is limited for the free plan as well, so be careful when configuring this parameter, I used at maximum 10 days of storage in order to do not run out of requests.


PS.: If it happens to you, you will have to create an new account on the api and generate a new API_KEY, then change in the variable mentioned above and it will be working again, otherwise we will have to pay for the api.
